### No Leg Up
*Five person team | Godot 4*

A gravity-based precision platformer. Initial team effort waned after several weeks of development, so I took a hands-on leadership role and put most of the game together solo.

### Dockside
*Four person team | Unity*

A cozy game about fishing. Similar to No Leg Up which would follow, team effort waned shortly after the start of development so I took initiative and carried the game further into development.
