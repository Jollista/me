# Music!
I'm not as confident in my music-making skills as I am in my ability to code things properly, and that's because I've been coding for waaaaaay longer than I've been doing anything musically. I tried to sort these in mostly chronological order, newest on top, but I forgot exactly when what was made, so it's really more just lumped in by category haha

Most of these were made with [beepbox](https://beepbox.co/)!

## Misc
Random stuff, disconnected from any game projects or anything like that. Stuff I just made for fun.

### Alarm
Made this song because I was watching a youtube video and a guy mentioned metroid prime and how the alarm in those games was integrated with the music so I wanted to do something kinda like that.

### E Piano 6 - Melody
Not a whole song, but a melody I got really attached to. I think part of why I liked it so much was that it reminds me of Wheatley's theme from Portal 2. Love that game.

### Graduation
Sorta melancholic song about some sorta melancholic feelings. Made it for fun and to get some stuff out.

### Shady Area
This was the first song I ever made that I liked. I'm not sure if I still like it, but I like the feelings I have associated with it, so that's nice.

## Lazarus
At **least** half of the music was made by [@summer_cashier](https://twitter.com/summer_cashier), whose music you can find her music on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@rosegarden8318) (please go listen to her stuff, it's really good and way better than anything I've ever done)

### Elevator
This song was made after the game jam I made Lazarus for had ended, because a friend said to me it could be funny if there was a scene at the beginning where your guy is in an elevator with their evil necromancer boss. Thought it could be fun to cook up a bossa nova track and make it a bit unsettling.

### Skelemen
I liked making this one a lot, especially because of the bit where it sounds like breathing. Big fan of that sound, but it's a bit short because I couldn't figure out where to go, y'know?

### Doomed
Similar to Skelemen, I like it as an intro, but I feel like it doesn't go anywhere and I'm not sure I'm smart enough to figure out where it should.

### Interviews
This was the song I was most proud of when making this game, and I think one of the things I'm most proud of with the game as a whole. It still has a lotta flaws, but it got the vibe I was trying to go for, and for that I'm still proud.

## Deadsteel
Deadsteel was a game I was working on a while back, but never finished. Got a bit too ambitious, I think, and bit off more than I could chew. Still, I put a lot of effort into the narrative of the game and I hope to come back to it someday, or at least the same setting. The idea was basically Enter the Gungeon, but instead of just moving around normal style, you're on a train, similar to like Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks, for instance. Cowboy kinda game. I like trains.

### Simple Bass
This song was originally made for Lazarus but I was just kinda riffing and it didn't fit the theme so I scrapped it for that game. It sorta fit the theme of Deadsteel though, so I kept it for that.

### Cowboy Song
This was intended to be a little song that would play during the intro. Specifically I was picturing something like the intro of Shovel Knight, with this played over it. I like the lil train soundin' stuff I threw in there.

### abge
Named it that because that's the notes in it. I made it just noodling around on my guitar and thought it sounded cool and cowboy-esque.
