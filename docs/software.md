# Software!
Here's a collection of miscellaneous software stuff I made. I like programming :)

## DATA.POOL

![datapool](img/datapool/datapool.png){: align="right" style="width:50%"}

[DATA.POOL](https://jollista.github.io/DATA.POOL/) is a discord bot assistant for Cyberpunk RED.

Same motivation I had for FLATLINE motivated me to make DATA.POOL. Here's its [documentation](https://jollista.github.io/DATA.POOL/), and its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/jollista/DATA.POOL/).

I had a lot of fun messing with the discord API and then a lot of pain figuring out how to deploy it. Ain't it always the way.

But it does work! And you can even invite it to your own server of TTRPG enthusiats!

## GameHunt

[GameHunt](https://game-hunt.vercel.app/) is a web app for tracking when games go on sale across multiple storefronts. Made with two other folks using Node, HTML, CSS, blah blah blah.

## FLATLINE
![flatline](img/flatline/Capture.JPG)

[FLATLINE](https://jollista.github.io/Flatline/) is a character creation helper website for Cyberpunk RED. 

I play a lot of TTRPGs and last time I ran Cyberpunk, I noticed that my friends had a bit of trouble dealing with the tedium of creating characters, especially the gear segment. So I made this to ideally make that process a lot faster and easier. It's not as functional as I'd like, and I might go back and try and make an actual better web app version with like express js or something. Right now it's just html/css/js. I don't hate it, though.
