# Software!
Here's a collection of miscellaneous software stuff I made. I like programming :)

## FLATLINE

[FLATLINE](https://jollista.github.io/Flatline/) is a character creation helper website for Cyberpunk RED. 

I play a lot of TTRPGs and last time I ran Cyberpunk, I noticed that my friends had a bit of trouble dealing with the tedium of creating characters, especially the gear segment. So I made this to ideally make that process a lot faster and easier. It's not as functional as I'd like, and I might go back and try and make an actual better web app version with like express js or something. Right now it's just html/css/js. I don't hate it, though.
