Unlike most of my games, it's a group project with a few other people from the Game Development Club at my school. My contributions so far aren't huge, mainly just the implementation of buttons and blocks, and a silly little undertale reference level.</p> <p>I'm really proud of the Undyne fight level, because I feel like I took the good parts of the sans level in No Leg Up but changed the parts that I didn't like (thanks to the people who playtested that sans level, btw). It has a health mechanic, much more content, and it's organized better in godot's file system as well as being just generally coded a bit better I think. I'm also much more proud of the artwork I put into it, even though it's still pretty rough haha</p> <p></p> <p> Play Slime Hop on itch.io</p>"},{"location":"games/#the-midnight-oil","title":"The Midnight Oil","text":"<p>Made with Godot 4.1.1 for a Halloween Jam for my school's Game Dev Club. I made it in godot because I like godot and I know how to use it well-ish enough to put something together in the like day that I had to work on it.</p> <p>It's my first ever horror game and I tried my best to base it on what I find scary, personally. Visually it was inspired a lot by Inscryption and I think that came across well. Like I accomplished what I sought out to with the game, but I'm not really satisfied with the end result as a whole because I feel like it's not a very fun game and that it ends pretty abruptly.</p> <p> </p> <p> Play The Midnight Oil on itch.io</p>"},{"location":"games/#lazarus","title":"Lazarus","text":"<p>Made with Unreal 5, a game about undead at the end of the world. I made it for the Summer Slow Jams 2023 Narrative jam as an excuse to learn Unreal. I also got to learn a bunch about how to use Blender, which was incredibly fun. Half of the game's music was made by @summer_cashier!</p> <p>I really want to use Unreal more, but I haven't quite had the time for it in addition to the projects I'm already working on. In the meantime, though, I've been practicing C++ a lot more so I can be more confident when I get to work more in Unreal.</p> <p> </p> <p> Play Lazarus on itch.io</p>"},{"location":"games/#no-leg-up","title":"No Leg Up","text":"<p>Made with Godot 4 for my school's Game Development Club, and my first successful group game project. The initial concept was a \"no legs platformer\" where you shift gravity instead of jumping and walking and stuff. It was originally supposed to be more of a puzzle platformer, but it ended up being more about precision, owing to a lot of inspiration from Celeste. </p> <p>I made all the levels as well all the art for the sansundertale level, and like half of the mechanics. I've been told it's very hard, and that's partly because the player's velocity isn't capped, but we never got around to implementing a terminal velocity. Also for the sans level since it's just one hit and you're dead it's even more difficult. Even still, I'm a little disappointed in my own lack of content with that because there's no ending reward or anything, so it's a bit anticlimactic.</p> <p> Play No Leg Up on itch.io</p>"},{"location":"games/#queenmaker","title":"Queenmaker","text":"<p>Made with Godot 4 for a game jam I didn't have time for, it's a barely functional game that I delisted from itch because it sucks. The only part about it that I at all was even somewhat ok with was the narrative, but even then it was just a lame Hollow Knight knockoff.</p> <p>Still, I did win $50 because of it, so that's cool.</p>"},{"location":"music/","title":"Music!","text":"<p>I'm not as confident in my music-making skills as I am in my ability to code things properly, and that's because I've been coding for waaaaaay longer than I've been doing anything musically. I tried to sort these in mostly chronological order, newest on top, but I forgot exactly when what was made, so it's really more just lumped in by category haha</p> <p>Most of these were made with beepbox!</p>"},{"location":"music/#misc","title":"Misc","text":"<p>Random stuff, disconnected from any game projects or anything like that. Stuff I just made for fun.</p>"},{"location":"music/#alarm","title":"Alarm","text":"<p>Made this song because I was watching a youtube video and a guy mentioned metroid prime and how the alarm in those games was integrated with the music so I wanted to do something kinda like that.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"music/#e-piano-6-melody","title":"E Piano 6 - Melody","text":"<p>Not a whole song, but a melody I got really attached to. I think part of why I liked it so much was that it reminds me of Wheatley's theme from Portal 2. Love that game.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"music/#graduation","title":"Graduation","text":"<p>Sorta melancholic song about some sorta melancholic feelings. Made it for fun and to get some stuff out.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"music/#shady-area","title":"Shady Area","text":"<p>This was the first song I ever made that I liked. I'm not sure if I still like it, but I like the feelings I have associated with it, so that's nice.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"music/#lazarus","title":"Lazarus","text":"<p>At least half of the music was made by @summer_cashier, whose music you can find her music on youtube (please go listen to her stuff, it's really good and way better than anything I've ever done)</p>"},{"location":"music/#elevator","title":"Elevator","text":"<p>This song was made after the game jam I made Lazarus for had ended, because a friend said to me it could be funny if there was a scene at the beginning where your guy is in an elevator with their evil necromancer boss. Thought it could be fun to cook up a bossa nova track and make it a bit unsettling.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"music/#skelemen","title":"Skelemen","text":"<p>I liked making this one a lot, especially because of the bit where it sounds like breathing. Big fan of that sound, but it's a bit short because I couldn't figure out where to go, y'know?</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"music/#doomed","title":"Doomed","text":"<p>Similar to Skelemen, I like it as an intro, but I feel like it doesn't go anywhere and I'm not sure I'm smart enough to figure out where it should.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"music/#interviews","title":"Interviews","text":"<p>This was the song I was most proud of when making this game, and I think one of the things I'm most proud of with the game as a whole. It still has a lotta flaws, but it got the vibe I was trying to go for, and for that I'm still proud.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"music/#deadsteel","title":"Deadsteel","text":"<p>Deadsteel was a game I was working on a while back, but never finished. Got a bit too ambitious, I think, and bit off more than I could chew. Still, I put a lot of effort into the narrative of the game and I hope to come back to it someday, or at least the same setting. The idea was basically Enter the Gungeon, but instead of just moving around normal style, you're on a train, similar to like Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks, for instance. Cowboy kinda game. I like trains.</p>"},{"location":"music/#simple-bass","title":"Simple Bass","text":"<p>This song was originally made for Lazarus but I was just kinda riffing and it didn't fit the theme so I scrapped it for that game. It sorta fit the theme of Deadsteel though, so I kept it for that.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"music/#cowboy-song","title":"Cowboy Song","text":"<p>This was intended to be a little song that would play during the intro. Specifically I was picturing something like the intro of Shovel Knight, with this played over it. I like the lil train soundin' stuff I threw in there.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"music/#abge","title":"abge","text":"<p>Named it that because that's the notes in it. I made it just noodling around on my guitar and thought it sounded cool and cowboy-esque.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"software/","title":"Software!","text":"<p>Here's a collection of miscellaneous software stuff I made. I like programming :)</p>"},{"location":"software/#flatline","title":"FLATLINE","text":"<p>FLATLINE is a character creation helper website for Cyberpunk RED. </p> <p>I play a lot of TTRPGs and last time I ran Cyberpunk, I noticed that my friends had a bit of trouble dealing with the tedium of creating characters, especially the gear segment. So I made this to ideally make that process a lot faster and easier. It's not as functional as I'd like, and I might go back and try and make an actual better web app version with like express js or something. Right now it's just html/css/js. I don't hate it, though.</p>"}]}
